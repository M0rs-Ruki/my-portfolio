# ðŸš€ My Learning Projects

This repository contains the core projects I've built as part of my journey into backend development and AI/ML. I'm learning by doing â€” documenting everything and building projects from scratch using JavaScript, Node.js, Python, and other modern tools.

## ðŸ”§ Projects Included

### ðŸ“º YouTube Backend API
A simulated backend for a YouTube-style platform built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Features user authentication, video upload routes, likes, comments, and view tracking.

### âœ… Task Manager + Note App
A RESTful backend for managing tasks and notes. Includes user registration, login, CRUD operations, and token-based authentication using JWT.

### ðŸ§  Neural Network from Scratch
A neural network built entirely with Python and NumPy â€” no external ML libraries used. Manually implemented forward propagation, activation functions, and backpropagation to train on basic datasets.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, **Express.js**
- **MongoDB**, **Mongoose**
- **Python**, **NumPy**
- **REST API**, **JWT Authentication**

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

These projects are part of my personal learning journey to understand real-world backend systems and foundational machine learning. I also document this journey through [my YouTube channel](#) (insert your link if available).
